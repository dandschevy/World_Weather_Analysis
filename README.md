# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose and Description
The purpose of the Module 6 Challege assignment was to create three separate deliverables:
  1.  Retrieve weather data
  2.  Create a customer travel destination map
  3.  Create a travel itinerary map

To accomplish this task, there were three separate sets of code written and those are located in the following three folders:
  1. Weather_Database Folder - retrieval of weather data
  2. Vacation_Search Folder - contains vacation search data
  3. Vacation_Intinerary Folder - contains data specific to 4 locations chosen on the same continent

In each of the folders referenced above is the code, maps and relevant csv files.
